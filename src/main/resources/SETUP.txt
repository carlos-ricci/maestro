Using Enterprise Integrator 6.x
===============================

Enterprise Integrator is the new version of the ESB which combines the capabilities of ESB, Data Services server, Business Process Server and Message Broker.

*** ALL the samples in this book are fully compatible with the current and future versions of Enterprise Integrator.  ***

There are slight changes related to the script that you use to run the Enterprise Integrator. Please refer https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI610/Quick+Start+Guide
for more details. There's nothing you need to do for the ESB configuration artifacts when you run them inside the EI 6.x.


*** If you are already running WSO2 ESB 5.0, there is no need of migrating to EI 6.0, unless you are using any of the advantages of repackaging structure of EI.
